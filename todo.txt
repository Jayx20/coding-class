**What we will do next time in Python**
- How to run the code on your own machine (we went over this a bit but need to make sure it works for everyone)
- Conditional Logic ( `if`/`else`)
- Loops (`while` and `for` loops)
- Built in math functions (`round()`, `floor()`, `ceil()`)
- Using random numbers
- Maybe error handling
- Using these to make a more complex program
